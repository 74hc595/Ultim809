Ultim809 Schematic and PCB Layout Files
=======================================

`ultim809.sch` is the up-to-date schematic in gEDA format.

`ultim809.pdf` is provided for those who do not have gEDA installed.

`bom.txt` is an up-to-date bill of materials, including sources and part numbers.

Snapshots of the schematic and PCB files for each board revision are included. Be aware that revision 0 has several design errors (steps to correct them are included in `bringup.pdf`) but it is included for completeness.
